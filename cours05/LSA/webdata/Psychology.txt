              The Psychology Department offers courses leading to the BA and MA 
              in psychology. Undergraduate students are exposed to the major 
              subfields of psychology (biological, clinical, developmental, 
              experimental, personality, social) as well as courses in their own 
              areas of interest. Majors design and conduct their own research 
              projects. Students may also have the opportunity to assist faculty 
              in their research or to do internships in the community (e.g., 
              Institute of Living, Wheeler Clinic, Elmcrest Hospital).
