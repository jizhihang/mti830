            Criminal Justice
              Although criminal justice is primarily a graduate program 
              offering, undergraduate students may concentrate in criminal 
              justice or apply for a special studies major in criminal justice. 
              This interdisciplinary field studies the definition of crime, the 
              causes and control of criminal behavior, and the operation of the 
              criminal justice system. Internships are available with the State 
              of Connecticut's criminal justice agencies.
