              The English Department offers courses and programs of study in 
              literature, writing, journalism, and linguistics. Beyond the 
              traditional canons of British and American literature, the 
              department offers a broad range of courses in literature, 
              different literary and creative writing genres, and various areas 
              of theoretical and applied linguistics. English majors pursue 
              course work or supplement the major with a concentration in 
              writing, journalism, linguistics or TESOL (Teaching English to 
              Speakers of Other Languages). A variety of internships are 
              available, particularly in journalism at local newspapers and 
              other print media work environments.
