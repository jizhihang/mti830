            Economics
              The bachelor's degree in economics is structured around course 
              work in economic theory, money and financial institutions, 
              international economics, economic forecasting, and the 
              relationship between government and the private sector. Majors may 
              pursue a specialization in operations research, a highly 
              quantified approach to decision-making in business and industry. 
              Economics majors often participate in internships with local 
              banks, insurance companies, accounting and brokerage firms, and 
              government agencies, or elect to complete three credit hours of 
              the major doing a cooperative education work experience.
