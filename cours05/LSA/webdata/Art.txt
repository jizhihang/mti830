              The Art Department's undergraduate degree program offers a wide 
              range of visual art options, including painting, printmaking, 
              sculpture, ceramics, and graphic design. Both concepts and 
              technical excellence are stressed within a curriculum that 
              encourages all forms of creative explorations via a developing 
              professional exchange with faculty. All majors must complete a 
              successful portfolio review of at least 10 works to become 
              eligible for upper division courses. Study plans for students are 
              developed on an individual basis consistent with the goals 
              identified by the student and the advisor. The department houses 
              within the Samuel Chen Art Center a gallery that offers regular 
              shows for professional exhibits, including the works of 
              internationally known artists Sol LeWitt, Cleve Gray, and Robert 
              Cottingham. Opportunities abound for internships with 
              community-based design firms, museums, and galleries.
