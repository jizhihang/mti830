              The Sociology Department offers degree programs and/or 
              concentrations in sociology, and social work. The sociology major 
              provides students with an understanding of the complex social 
              structures and processes that connect their private lives and 
              experiences to both their own society and the global society. 
              Within either a general or honors track, students select courses 
              from the following areas: sociology and law, sociology and 
              research methods, sociology and social services, sociology and 
              health care, sociology and business, and social inequity.
