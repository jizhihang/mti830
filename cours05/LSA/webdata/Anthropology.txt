            Anthropology
              Anthropology consists of four subfields: cultural anthropology, 
              physical anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics. Beyond these 
              subfields, concentrations are offered in biological anthropology 
              and cross-cultural comparison. The anthropology major provides 
              students with a broad social and behavioral science background and 
              prepares students for a range of careers, from public service to 
              marketing and international management. Through independent study, 
              students work closely with faculty doing research. Students 
              regularly attend professional anthropology meetings and other 
              discipline-related events. Special programs include summer field 
              schools in archaeology, internships in applied anthropology, and 
              participation in department-sponsored diversity training 
              institutes.
