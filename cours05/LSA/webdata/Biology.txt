            Biological Sciences
              The undergraduate and graduate degrees offered by the Department 
              of Biological Sciences explore the discipline broadly. Specialized 
              undergraduate programs are available in medical technology and 
              environmental science and interpretation; also available are 
              specialized graduate programs in nurse anesthesia and health 
              sciences. Students preparing for various health and medical 
              professions are advised primarily by the department's pre-health 
              professions advisor. All undergraduate programs require a research 
              project or internship. Many laboratories, a greenhouse, herbarium, 
              experimental garden, controlled environmental rooms, cell culture 
              and protein purification facilities, photosynthesis research 
              laboratory, growth chambers, and computer laboratory are available 
              for research and instruction.
