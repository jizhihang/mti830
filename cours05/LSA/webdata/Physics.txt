            Physics/Earth Sciences
              The Physics and Earth Sciences Department has numerous 
              introductory and intermediate/advanced laboratories as well as two 
              teaching laboratories, an observatory containing a 16-inch 
              telescope, a 100-seat planetarium, a 400-kv Van de Graaff linear 
              accelerator, an ion implanter, and a fully-equipped weather 
              center. Using these facilities, the faculty teach a variety of 
              courses in geology, astronomy, meteorology, oceanography, 
              mechanics, optics, electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics, and 
              astrophysics. Faculty research areas include atomic collisions, 
              ground water pollution, particle physics, solid state physics, 
              applied holography, and general relativity. Whenever possible, 
              students enrolled in the physics major assist the faculty with 
              their ongoing studies.
