            Geography
              Concerned with the science of location, the Geography Department 
              faculty teach students to use maps, air photos, computers, and 
              information about places to understand how people use the land 
              they live on and what makes land different from other areas. 
              Students learn about the nature of places, human impacts on 
              environment, and the proper use of land. Career opportunities 
              include travel and tourism, environmental protection, urban, 
              regional, and transportation planning, map making, and area 
              studies.
