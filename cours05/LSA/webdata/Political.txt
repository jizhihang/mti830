              The BA in political science is structured around course work in 
              political theory, comparative government, international relations 
              and organization, public law, public administration, and state and 
              local government. Political science majors may specialize in 
              public administration. Others chose one or more international and 
              area studies concentrations. Legislative internships are available 
              for those who want to observe practical politics firsthand and to 
              gain governmental experience. In addition, the applied research 
              activities of the Center for Social Research provide a range of 
              real world learning experiences. Pre-law students are advised by 
              faculty in the Political Science Department.
