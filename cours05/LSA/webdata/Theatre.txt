              technical theatre, general theatre, and dance are offered by the 
              theatre Department. Beyond or in conjunction with course work, 
              students have the opportunity to participate in at least four 
              major campus productions a year plus a Broadway student production 
              in New York City's theatre district. Design students work in 
              lighting, sound, costumes, or scenery for main stage productions.
