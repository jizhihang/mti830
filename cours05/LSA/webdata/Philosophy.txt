              philosophy, the department offers a broad spectrum of courses 
              reflecting the diversity of both Western and non-Western thought. 
              A specialization in applied ethics is available as well as an 
              interdisciplinary concentration in religious studies. The 
              department is also the academic home for the University's Honors
